# Tank War - Project Part 2

by Sarah, Ruby, Celina

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Open file:** Unzip and open the folder Tank-War in an IDE.
2.  **Open Terminal:** Use VScode and open terminal while the folder is opened will automatically navigate.
3.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**  If you are using Terminal or Powershell, use the `cd` command to change into the project folder you just extracted. For example:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TankWar_csproject
    ```
    (Replace `path/to/your/TankWar_csproject` with the actual path to the folder).
4.  **Virtual Environment (optional):** Run: 
	```bash
	python -m venv .venv
	.venv\Scripts\activate
	``` 
	You should see a (.venv) in command line.
5.  **Install Pygame:** Run the following command in your terminal to install the Pygame library (if you don't already have it):
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
    *(Recommendation: It's best practice to install packages within a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts, but it's not strictly necessary for simply running this game).*

## Running the Game

After completing the setup, make sure your terminal is still in the project directory, and run the following command to start the game:

```bash
python main.py
```
